## My project is divided into the following layers:

- ### View

- ### Application

- ### Api

### The view layer is divided into:
 
- ### Presentation: This layer accepts data and throws events. It does not have access to the API (Header, Loader, Spinner, CourseDetails, CourseLesson, CoursesListPage, CourseSection, SkillsSection)

- ### Structural: This layer is responsible for the structure (App, Layout)

- ### Container: This layer communicates with the Application layer (CoursePage, CoursesList)

### The –êpplication layer contains hooks and communicates with the API layer (useUpdateVideoMeta, useCurrentLesson, usePreviewCourse, usePreviewCourses, useToken)

### The API layer contains requests to the server, API providers and communicates with the Domain (fetchPreviewCourse, fetchPreviewCourses, fetchToken, ApiProvider, AuthProvider)
